# Test: ANEWED.
Play it on Newgrounds or itch.io. If you find this game somewhere else it has been stolen/pirated.
## Version 1.0.1 is coming!
### (currently in the merging stage)
* Security improvements and visual fixes (still not perfect but still much better)
* Switched from `vw` unit to `%` and `px` since the `vw` is too inconsistent between screen sizes and often looks bad
* Minified the CSS and JS for faster performance
* Added a content security policy
* Added a copyright meta tag
