# If you edit in this repoitory:
* Use two space indentation,
* Use strict mode for JavaScript:
  * write `"strict mode"` under `<script>` (no indentation),
* Always close empty elements:
  * `<br>` should be written as `<br/>`,
* Never skip optional elements like `<!DOCTYPE html>`, and `<head>`,
* Nest elements properly:
  * Example: `<p>This is a very long sentence <b>depending on who you ask.</b></p>`,
* Use camelCase,
* Always check if the code works properly,
* `<html>` must not have indentation after `<!DOCTYPE html>`,
* keep spaces around equal signs in JavaScript:
  * `document.getElementById("id").style.display = "none";`,
* keep a space before the curly brace in CSS and JavaScript:
  * CSS: `body {`,
  * JS: `function one() {`.
